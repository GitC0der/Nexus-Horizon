# Nexus-Horizon
This is a custom project done at EPFL as part of the third year course "CS-341: Introduction to Computer Graphics".

It was named "Nexus Horizon" as a nexus is "a connection or series of connections linking two or more things" and this is precisely what it is about: a procedurally generated futuristic city consisting of mainly cuboid-like buildings containing windows, doors, lamps, railings, couches, outdoor sitting lounges, utility structures and more. The key "R" can be pressed to each time recreate a different scene.

# Nexus Horizon
This is a custom project developed at EPFL as part of the third year course "CS-341: Introduction to Computer Graphics".

It was named "Nexus Horizon" as a nexus is "a connection or series of connections linking two or more things" and this is precisely what it is about: a procedurally generated futuristic city consisting of mainly cuboid-like buildings containing windows, doors, lamps, railings, couches, outdoor sitting lounges, utility structures and more. The key "R" can be pressed each time to recreate a new city.

## How to Run
In order to view the generated city, please open Nexus Horizon in a Unity project, then go to the Project view, and open SampleScene under Assets/Scenes, before pressing the play button.

## Random Generation
The city is generated based on a particular seed. If you wish to have random generation enabled, please select the Game Manager object in the Hierarchy view under SampleScene/Game Manager and finally, in the Inspector view, set the Seed value of the Game Manager script to a non-positive number. Changing it to any other value will modify the seed and give a deterministic scene.
